# R-Promise

A typescript [Promise](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-promise-objects)
implementation that can pass [Promises/A+](https://promisesaplus.com/) tests

> [!NOTE]  
> Please note that Promise/A+ is slightly different from ECMA262 Promise, as the Promise/A+ cares more about the library interoperability.
> We can even say that Promise/A+ is a superset of ECMA262 Promise.
